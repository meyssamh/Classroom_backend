# Classroom
This project was developed with using a variety of technologies, including [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

I utilized [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for bundling, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting, and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for UI design in this MVP project.

If you are interested in the front-end code of this project, you can find it in [Classroom_frontend](https://github.com/meyssamh/Classroom_frontend).

I plan on updating this project soon, so stay tuned for more updates!
